We have minimal assumptions on the stock price\. We assume that the price process P can be embedded in a finite dimension Markov system, called Z\. For example, this is the case of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process\, which is already Markov, or the Heston model, where the stochastic couple price-volatility forms a Markov system\. In particular, we assume that the conditional expectation of the price  increment is defined by a function epsilon, depending on t and z, and the same holds for the average integrated volatility, denoted by ro 2.
